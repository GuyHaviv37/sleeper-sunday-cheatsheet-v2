# Create T3 App

This is an app bootstrapped according to the [init.tips](https://init.tips) stack, also known as the T3-Stack.

# TODO
- Login page: Styling - Title animations/gradient, hover effects for button
- Settings page: loading state on submit
- Validation: check that leagues are actually available i.e., renewed and active
### Basic view: 
- scores UI: add league names to context for PlayerModal
- scrollbar for web (tailwind-scrollbar)
### Roots vs. boos view: N/A?
### Optional?:
- missing players in total
- main data props -> context for better visibilty
- missing images for 2021 rookies
